# Identifying Risk Factors and Preferred Hospitals for Hip/Knee Replacements: An Analysis of 2024 Hospital Readmission Reduction Program Data  

## Project Overview  
Since 2012, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have implemented the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) to track and reduce unnecessary hospital readmissions through financial penalties. This project aims to analyze the 2024 HRRP data to identify preferred and non-preferred hospitals for hip and knee replacements for a health insurance company, as well as to determine the risk factors associated with higher readmission rates for these procedures.
